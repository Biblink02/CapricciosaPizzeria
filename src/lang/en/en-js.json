    "interior_design_atmosphere_label": "Interior design and atmosphere",
    "interior_design_atmosphere": "Capricciosa is made with a play of contrasts: a modern cut and a delicately vintage flavor. The tables on the veranda were recovered from an old bacaro, the handcrafted Cerasarda tiles contrast the minimal iron tables and the Olev glass lighting created by master glassmakers enhances the color of the modern Thibaut wallpapers, made in America. There is also a piano, one of the latest models built with wood from the Fiemme valley, which invites, as in the venues of the past, live performances. The wood used inside Capricciosa comes from the recovery of a 19th century villa, expertly crafted by an imaginative Venetian craftsman. It is a visual harmony that recalls that of jazz-blues which also vibrates in the countless Bose speakers present in the venue.",
    "menu_quality_label": "Menu quality",
    "menu_quality": "What about our menu chosen with particular attention to the quality of the PDO or organic raw materials, to have genuine in all aspects, both organoleptic and healthy. The dough is a highly digestible semi-wholemeal dough, because the \"after\" of pizza is also important. We have also decided to propose as an alternative cold cuts or cheese platters to pair with the wines in our wine shop which we have pleasantly called Viziosa: it contains wine from small wineries with limited production and artisanal care.",
